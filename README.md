A typical annotation process using DoTAT may include the following five steps:

(1) Define  annotation  specifications:   The  administrator  selects  the  annotation  type  andvisually defines event types, entity types, relation types or text categories in annotation specifications.

(2) Create and assign tasks: Administrator creates and assigns tasks. Each task contains anannotation specification and several raw texts. It is recommended that two annotators andone reviewer are assigned to each task.

(3) Annotate: Before the annotators interactively annotate events or entities, they can use automatic batch annotation to accelerate the speed. The event annotation interface of DoTAT contains event list panel (top) and annotation panel (bottom), as shown in the Figure:

(4) Merge and Review: The reviewer starts consistency checking and automatic merging ofthe annotated content by multiple annotators. The reviewer can visually analyze the errors according to the merged events list.  When there are too many similar errors, the reviewer can give feedback for administrator to re-definethe annotation specification.   With iterative annotation function, all exsisting annotationscan be reused.

(5) Export results: After the review process, theannotated content can be exported by admin-istrator to a result file and saved in JSON format.

During the trial period, the user's task management rights and annotation specification management rights will be opened. You will need to contact us to apply for the administrator account in the future.
